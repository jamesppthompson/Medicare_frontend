            third party, in whole or in part, in any form, whether modified or
            unmodified.

            Licensee recognizes that Licensor regards the Licensed Programs as

            Licensee treats its own confidential information and in no event
            with less care than is reasonably required to protect the

            shall at its expense verify and attempt to correct such errors. If
            Licensee is not satisfied with the correction, then Licensee may
            terminate this Agreement, but without refund of any amount paid to
            Licensor or release of any amounts due Licensor at the time of
            termination.

            efforts provide consulting to answer such questions without charge

          <h3>10. PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITY</h3>
          <p>
            Licensor will defend at its own expense any action brought against
            Licensee to the extent it is based on a claim that the Licensed
            Programs used within the scope of the license granted hereunder
            infringe a United States patent, copyright or other proprietary
            right of a third party.
            <span class="color_red">Licensor will pay any costs, damages or attorney fees finally
              awarded against Licensee in such action which are attributable to
              such claim,</span>
            provided Licensor is promptly notified in writing of such claim, may
            control the defense and/or settlement of such claim, and is provided
            with all requested assistance, information and authority. In the
            event that a Licensed Program becomes, or in Licensor's opinion is
            likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of a United
            States patent, copyright or trade secret, Licensor may at its option
            either secure Licensee's right to continue using the Licensed
            Programs, replace or modify the Licensed Programs to make them not
            infringing, or provide Licensee with a refund of the license fee
            less depreciation on a 5 (five) year, straight-line basis. Licensor
            shall have no liability for any claim of patent, copyright or trade
            secret infringement based on the use of a Licensed Program in any
            form other than the original, unmodified form provided to Licensee
            or the use of a combination of the Licensed Programs with hardware,
            software or data not supplied by Licensor where the used Licensed
            Programs alone in their original, unmodified form would not
            constitute an infringement. The foregoing states Licensee's entire
            liability for infringement or claims of infringement of patents,
            copyrights or other intellectual property right.

            Licensee agrees that the following steps will be used to settle any
            controversy or claim, including, but not limited to, errors and/or
            omissions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach
            thereof.

          <p><strong>a.Negotiation.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Licensee agrees that they will attempt to resolve any controversy,
            claim, or dispute (Dispute) relating to this Agreement by prompt,
            good faith negotiations. Any Dispute which is not settled by the
            Parties within thirty (30) days after written notice of a Dispute is
            given by one Party to the other shall be referred to arbitration
            pursuant to Clause 2 below.
          </p>

          <p><strong>b.Arbitration. </strong></p>
          <p>
            Any dispute, claim or controversy, including but not limited to,
            errors and omissions arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement
            or any alleged breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity of this Agreement (including the determination of the scope
            or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate), which is not
            resolved pursuant to Clause 1 above, shall be settled by arbitration
            in Washington DC. Such arbitration will be administered by JAMS, The
            Resolution Experts (JAMS) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration
            Rules & Procedures or, if applicable, its Streamlined Arbitration
            Rules & Procedures. The award of the arbitration panel shall be
            final and binding, and judgment upon the award granted may be
            entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Damages that are
            inconsistent with any applicable agreement between the Parties, that
            are punitive in nature, or that are not measured by the prevailing
            Partys actual damages, shall be unavailable in arbitration or any
            other forum. In no event, even if any other portion of these
            provisions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, shall the
            arbitration panel have power to make an award or impose a remedy
            that could not be made or imposed by a court deciding the matter in
            the same jurisdiction. The arbitrator will, in the award, allocate
            all of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the not
            prevail.

              state securities laws. Client acknowledges that his/her/its
